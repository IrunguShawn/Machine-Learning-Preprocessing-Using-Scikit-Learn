# Machine-Learning-Preprocessing-Using-Scikit-Learn
This Repository will take you through machine learning preprocessing. How to ordinary encode 2 categorical data and also One Hot Encode Multiple categorical variables. And also spliting the data to both train and test data. After modeling the training dataset I cross validated the model to tell the variance explained in our model.
